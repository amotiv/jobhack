# Railway Deployment Error Report

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUE: Database Connection Failure**

### **Error Summary**
Railway deployment is failing with PostgreSQL connection errors. The Django app cannot connect to the database during migration, preventing the application from going live.

### **Error Details**
```
django.db.utils.OperationalError: connection failed: connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
Multiple connection attempts failed. All failures are:
- host: 'localhost', port: '5432', hostaddr: '::1': connection failed: connection to server at "::1", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
- host: 'localhost', port: '5432', hostaddr: '127.0.0.1': connection failed: connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**
The Django app is attempting to connect to `localhost:5432` instead of using Railway's PostgreSQL database. This indicates:

1. **Missing PostgreSQL Service**: Railway's PostgreSQL database service is not properly connected
2. **Environment Variable Issue**: `DATABASE_URL` is not being set by Railway
3. **Service Dependencies**: Django service is not linked to the database service
4. **Configuration Problem**: Railway's automatic database connection is not working

### **Current Configuration**
- **Repository**: https://github.com/amotiv/jobhack.git
- **Railway Settings**: `backend/api/settings_railway.py`
- **Start Command**: 
  ```bash
  cd backend && DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings_railway python manage.py migrate && DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings_railway python manage.py seed_jobs && DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.settings_railway gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 1 api.wsgi:application
  ```

### **Required Actions**

#### **1. Railway Service Setup**
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database service to Railway project
- [ ] Ensure database service is connected to Django service
- [ ] Verify service dependencies in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Check that `DATABASE_URL` is automatically provided

#### **2. Environment Variables**
Set these in Railway's Variables tab:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
DEBUG=0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

#### **3. Database Configuration**
The `settings_railway.py` file should handle Railway's `DATABASE_URL` format:
```python
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
if DATABASE_URL:
    # Parse Railway's postgresql://user:password@host:port/database format
    # ... parsing logic exists in settings_railway.py
```

### **Troubleshooting Steps**

#### **Step 1: Verify Railway Services**
1. Go to Railway project dashboard
2. Check if PostgreSQL service exists
3. Verify it's connected to the Django service
4. Look for `DATABASE_URL` in environment variables

#### **Step 2: Check Railway Logs**
1. View deployment logs in Railway dashboard
2. Look for environment variable values
3. Check for database connection attempts
4. Verify service startup order

#### **Step 3: Test Database Connection**
1. Check if `DATABASE_URL` is being set
2. Verify the URL format is correct
3. Test connection with a simple script if needed

### **Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Manual Database Setup**
If automatic connection fails:
1. Manually set database environment variables
2. Use individual `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, etc. variables
3. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running

#### **Option 2: Simplified Start Command**
Try a simpler approach:
```bash
cd backend && python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb && python manage.py seed_jobs && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT api.wsgi:application
```

#### **Option 3: Debug Mode**
Add debugging to see what's happening:
```bash
cd backend && python -c "import os; print('DATABASE_URL:', os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))" && python manage.py migrate
```

### **Files to Review**
- `backend/api/settings_railway.py` - Database configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- `Procfile` - Start command configuration
- Railway dashboard - Service connections and environment variables

### **Expected Outcome**
- Django app connects to Railway's PostgreSQL database
- Migrations run successfully
- Health check passes at `/api/health/`
- Application becomes accessible at Railway URL
- Job data is seeded automatically

### **Priority Level**
**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL** - This is blocking the entire deployment and preventing the JobHack application from going live.

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Application accessible via Railway URL
- [ ] All 15 job listings loaded

### **Next Steps**
1. **Immediate**: Add PostgreSQL service to Railway project
2. **Verify**: Check service connections and environment variables
3. **Test**: Monitor deployment logs for connection success
4. **Validate**: Confirm health check passes
5. **Deploy**: Ensure application is live and functional

---

**Note**: This error is preventing the JobHack application from deploying successfully to Railway. The application is fully functional locally but cannot connect to Railway's database infrastructure.
